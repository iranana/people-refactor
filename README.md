The exercise is to clean up this code and put it in a sensible structure, using the best of idiomatic ES, modern libraries, and frameworks possible. The application runs correctly, but there's a lot of duplication and tangling of concerns, the rendering is all server-side, and its filtering use case is limited.

## Important - the requirements

- The code must run in the latest 8.x version of Node
- The code must be able to be built and run with npm commands - no extra scripts or tools that can't be run started from what's in the package.json
- You are welcome to introduce any libraries you feel are useful, but these must run on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Use React as a Single Page App
- Generalise the filtering system (e.g. so you can select all people who are both male and 20 years old)

## Guidance

There is no "right answer", but some good things to do might be:

- Use Redux, or your favourite state management library
- Introduce a task runner (we like Webpack :-)) with a transpiler to take advantage of even more modern ES features
- Separate concerns: untangle business logic, web serving, and data access
- Use ES6+ features (only the ones available in Node 6.x) to improve the readability, scoping, reuse, and checking
- Introduce a linter
- Improve the configurability by replacing hardcoding of values with appropriate mechanisms for specifying them
- Improve error handling
- Add useful comments
- Add logging

## Most importantly: show us what you can do!
